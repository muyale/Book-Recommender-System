## Book Recommendation System

### Overview
This project is a book recommendation system inspired by my experience in a book club. The system uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to recommend books based on the author and publisher of a book a user loves or is currently reading.

### Features
- Input a book title to receive recommendations of similar books.
- Recommendations are based on the unique words in each book, making them more relevant to the user's interests.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- TF-IDF for text analysis
- Cosine similarity for book comparison

### Future Enhancements
- Implement a user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
- Incorporate user feedback to improve recommendation accuracy.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my book club friends for inspiring this project and my mentors for their guidance and support.
